This is draft software for the Cosmic Debris League

There are several components:

1. Web page which is what the auctioneer will use throughout the draft: nav.html
  This will reside at http://lfeder.com/txn/nav.html

2. The javascript that creates the AJAX request of the google sheet google-sheet.js

3. The google script (javascript) accessed from the sheet (tools/script editor) code.gs

4. The google sheet itself

=========================================================================================================
Also in Github is the requirement/design document: "Specs for draft software.docx". It's old and needs to be updated but there are notes in there that I will refer to when I get to certain functions that I want to build.
