There are several components:

1. Web page which is what the auctioneer will use throughout the draft: nav.html
  This will reside at http://lfeder.com/txn/nav.html

2. The javascript that creates the AJAX request of the google sheet google-sheet.js

3 The google script (javascript) accessed from the sheet (tools/script editor) code.js

4. The google sheet itself
